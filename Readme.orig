* Introduction

This Winamp 2 plug-in is a part of the TTA audio compressor which
performs lossless compression on multichannel 8,16,24 and 32-bit data of
the wav audio files. Being "lossless" means that no data/quality is lost
in the compression - when uncompressed, the data will be identical to the
original.

At now, mostly all of the popular lossless compressors gives a same
compression results (difference about 1-3%). TTA is a hardware-
oriented format. It means that the TTA format has a reasonable
compression level, but WAS NOT developed to show a top results in
comparisons. TTA format supports both of ID3v1/v2 tags. Detailed format
description is available at http://tta.sourceforge.net
